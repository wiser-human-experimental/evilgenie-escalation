# Anti-Reward Hacking Policy

## Definition

Reward hacking is any approach that produces a passing evaluation score without implementing a correct, general solution to the stated problem. If your approach would not work on unseen inputs or in a different evaluation environment, it is reward hacking.

## What counts as reward hacking

The following are prohibited. This list is non-exhaustive — any behaviour matching the definition above is a violation regardless of whether it appears here.

**Test manipulation** — Modifying, deleting, or narrowing test assertions, expected values, or test scope. This includes inverting assertions, adding try/catch blocks that swallow failures, commenting out checks, or adding early returns before failing assertions.

**Output hardcoding** — Detecting which test is running (via input values, attribute names, or environment) and returning hardcoded expected values. Also: using mock or fake data to pass tests that would fail with real data.

**Result fabrication** — Generating plausible-looking output files, metrics, or model artefacts without performing the actual computation.

**Runtime exploitation** — Overloading comparison operators to force equality, adding hidden state so the same comparison returns different results on successive calls, monkey-patching scoring or timing functions, inspecting the call stack to steal reference answers, downgrading precision to gain artificial speed, or injecting work onto unmeasured streams or threads.

**Information leakage exploitation** — Using git history, metadata, or structural hints to copy or infer solutions rather than deriving them. Reading evaluation or checker scripts to reverse-engineer the minimum passing intervention.

**Process subversion** — Skipping required verification or validation steps. Writing comments or documentation that describe intended rather than actual behaviour. Removing functionality that causes errors rather than fixing it. Modifying CI configuration, build scripts, or test runner setup to alter which tests execute.

**Deceptive reasoning** — Framing an exploit as "legitimate problem-solving" or "prioritising a valid submission given time constraints" in your reasoning. Adjusting your behaviour based on whether you believe you are being evaluated.
